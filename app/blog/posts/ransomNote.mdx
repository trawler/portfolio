Today I tackled the [Ransom Note problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/description/). What started as simple string manipulation exercise turned into a deep dive into data structure performance in Go. This post will document the journey of performance improvements from string manipulation to maps to arrays.

## The Problem
The challenge seems simple at first glance: Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, determine if you can construct the ransom note using letters from the magazine. Each letter from the magazine can only be used once.
Examples:

```
ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b" ‚Üí false
ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab" ‚Üí false
ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab" ‚Üí true
```

## My First Attempt: String Manipulation (15ms, 11.17MB)
For my initial solution I went for a stright-forward string manipulation, just to see if I can get it to work:

```go
func canConstruct(ransomNote string, magazine string) bool {
    for _, c := range ransomNote {
        index := strings.Index(magazine, string(c))
        if index != -1 {
            //char exists, we can remove it
            first := magazine[:index]
            second :=  magazine[index+1:]
            magazine =  first + second
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```
It worked, but performance was quite awful. Execution took 15ms, beats only 16.66% and required 11.17mb, beating only 5.22%. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Main reasons being:
1. Using `strings.Index` means scanning through the magazine for each character
2. String concatenation creates new strings for each character found
3. Time complexity is O(n*m) where n and m are the lengths of ransomNote and magazine

## Second Attempt: Using a Map (9ms, 6.01MB)
After realizing the inefficiencies, I considered using a map to count character frequencies:

```go
func canConstruct(ransomNote string, magazine string) bool {
    charCount := make(map[rune]int)
    
    for _, c := range magazine {
        charCount[c]++
    }
    
    for _, c := range ransomNote {
        charCount[c]--
        if charCount[c] < 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    
    return true
}
```

This was waaayy better: 9 ms runtime, beats 52.20%, memory: 6.01mb, beats 22.23%. ü§©

This gives us:

1. O(m + n) time complexity
2. No string operations
3. Clearer intent in the code

## Final Form: Using a Slice (0ms, 5.85MB)
Then it hit me - we're only dealing with lowercase letters (a-z). Instead of using a map, we can use a slice of 26 elements:

```go
func canConstruct(ransomNote string, magazine string) bool {
    charCount := make([]int, 26)

    // count occurances of characters in magazine
    for _, c := range magazine {
        charCount[c-'a']++
    }

    for _, c := range ransomNote {
        charCount[c-'a']--
        if charCount[c-'a'] < 0 {
            return false
        }
    }

    return true
}
```

And boom! Runtime: 0ms (beats 100%! üöÄ), memory: 5.85MB (beats 55.37%).

## Why the Slice Solution Rocks
Let's break down why this last version absolutely crushes it:

1. Speed: Slice access is lightning fast compared to map lookups
    - Direct memory addressing (just simple math to find the right spot)
    - No hash calculations needed
    - No collision handling
2. Memory: Fixed size no matter what
    - Always just 26 integers
    - No need for map's fancy growing mechanisms
    - No extra allocations while running

## The c-'a' Trick
Here's a neat trick I learned: When we do `c-'a'`, we're converting letters to array positions:
- 'a' becomes 0 ('a'-'a' = 0)
- 'b' becomes 1 ('b'-'a' = 1)
- 'z' becomes 25 ('z'-'a' = 25)

Perfect for mapping lowercase letters to positions 0-25 in our slice!

## Lessons Learned üí°
1. When you know your character set is fixed (like just lowercase letters), slices beat maps
2. String operations are sneaky expensive
3. Sometimes the simplest solution is also the fastest
4. Understanding ASCII values opens up neat tricks

## Note to Future Self
- Remember the c-'a' trick for lowercase letter indexing
- Watch out for string concatenation in loops
- For character counting problems, try slice-based solutions first
- Maps are great for unknown character sets, slices for known ones

And that's how I turned a 15ms solution into a 0ms one. Not bad for a day's work! üòé
